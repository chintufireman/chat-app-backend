#*Redis*

1.Receiver (Message Listener): The receiver component listens for messages published to a specific Redis channel. It can be implemented by creating a receiver class that implements the MessageListener interface and overrides the onMessage method. Alternatively, you can directly implement the MessageListener interface without using a separate receiver class. The receiver component processes the received messages.

2.Redis Connection Listener: You can implement a Redis connection listener to track the status of the Redis connection. This listener can be used to handle events like connection established, connection closed, or connection error. You can implement the RedisConnectionFailureListener interface and override the necessary methods to handle these events. This component provides visibility into the state of the Redis connection.

3.Publisher: The publisher component is responsible for publishing messages to Redis. It uses the StringRedisTemplate or RedisTemplate class provided by Spring Data Redis to convert and send messages to a specified Redis channel. The publisher component can be implemented as a separate class that injects the StringRedisTemplate or RedisTemplate and provides a method to publish messages.
